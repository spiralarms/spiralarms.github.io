The inductive step is 
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\phi^{n-1}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\phi^{n-2}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\phi^{n-2}(\phi-1)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\phi^n$, 
because $\phi^2=\phi+1$, and all that is true for $\psi$ too. 
The formula in the book is correct. 
$\psi<0$, so its integer powers are very small for large $n$.
