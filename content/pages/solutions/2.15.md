Eva (and W.Z.) is right. We need to distinguish between dependent and
independent intervals. In the formula for resistance $R_1$ and
$R_2$ are independent intervals (they correspond to resistance
of physically different resistors), and in procedure `par1` two
occurrences of $R_1$ are dependent intervals. When we calculate
the ratio $A/A$ we cannot suppose that those two intervals
$A$ are independent, we cannot choose their values
independently. If we randomly choose the value inside the interval
$A$, we must assign this value to both occurrences of $A$ in the formula.
For independent intervals the situation is
different, we may choose one value inside $A$, some other value
inside $B$, and their ratio will have meaning, namely this will
be some value inside the interval which is the ratio of two intervals,
$A/B$. Alyssa's package treats all occurrences of the same
interval in a complex formula as independent intervals and the answers
are wrong. The calculation of $A/A$ by Alyssa's package gives
wrong result.
