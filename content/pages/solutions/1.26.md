Let argument `exp` be `n`. The number of steps for iterative
process can be expressed by recurrency $T(n)=T(n/2)+O(1)$, with
solution $O(\log{}n)$.

Louis replaced fast iterative process with recursive one, that
splits in two branches for even `n`. This corresponds to different
recurrency $T(n)=2 T(n/2)+O(1)$, with solution $O(n)$.
